# React Sharing by An

Im sure most people have taken some kind of course teaching React from create-react-app. I will be taking a different approach by showing you how you can start from a good ol index.html file to getting a React app up. Things you will learn will be

1. Wtf are bundlers (note: not going in-depth with Webpack or what. Just a high level on what module bundlers are)

2. Wtf is JSX

3. React vs React DOM?

4. Components, Props and State

5. Class Components vs Functional Components

6. List and Keys

The topics covered, I'd argue, are the foundations of React that some people might have missed when learning React on the job/Youtube tutorials. Thus, the sharing will be a good introduction to React, as well as a good refresher for existing React devs

Commits are atomic. So it is advisable to just go through this app commit-by-commit when you are reviewing
